# SingleStone Cloud/DevOps Engineer Recruiting Exercises

Thank you for participating in our candidate screening process and for agreeing to complete the assigned technical exercise. We understand that you may have a limited amount of time to work on the exercise, so allow us to offer some guidance:

- The exercises build upon each other, so complete them in order.
- To the best of your ability, deliver a fully functional solution, but we don't expect you to spend more than a few hours on this. An incomplete solution still helps us understand how you approach the problem.
- Use the exercise as a chance to showcase your skills. There are opportunities to layer in some additional (and unspecified) good engineering practices.
- If you must make concessions in your implementation due to time constraints, please document them as thoroughly as possible in the README.

## Initial Setup

You will need an AWS account to complete these exercises. We recommend creating a new AWS account so that you will have a clean environment. The exercises have been designed to run in the free tier. Once the interview process is complete be sure to destroy any cloud resources you have created to avoid being charged.

## Submission Guidelines

To submit your completed exercises,

1. Push them to a public Git repository. (You may use a throwaway GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket account to stay anonymous if you wish.)  Your submission should include documentation (Markdown is preferred), any code you have written, _and_ the assets we provided as part of the exercise. It should be a complete, runnable solution, and your documentation should include any information the reviewer needs to build/run/test your solution.
1. Send an email to recruiting@singlestoneconsulting.com. Include a hyperlink to your repository and hyperlinks to your running implementations of the [API (exercise 1)](exercise_1/) and to the [web cluster (exercise 2)](exercise_2/). (We'll get back to you soon, at which point you can terminate any cloud resources. It should all run within the free tier.)

## Exercises
