# Exercise 1 â€“ Serverless API

Using the [provided Python application code](fortune_handler/) as a starting point, deploy an AWS Lambda-backed API behind an Application Load Balancer. Deploy all infrastructure using an Infrastructure as Code tool (CloudFormation/SAM/CDK or Terraform are strongly preferred). The API should be publicly accessible. Consider how to increase the application's observability (metrics and logs).
