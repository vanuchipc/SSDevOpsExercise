# Exercise 1 â€“ Serverless API

Using the [provided Python application code](fortune_handler/) as a starting point, deploy an AWS Lambda-backed API behind an Application Load Balancer. Deploy all infrastructure using an Infrastructure as Code tool (CloudFormation/SAM/CDK or Terraform are strongly preferred). The API should be publicly accessible. Consider how to increase the application's observability (metrics and logs).

### I have never done problems like these, and have very little to no experience using AWS and CDK, but I was able to put together a working solution that I hope fulfills all of the requirements.
### I had to use a lot of the AWS documentation available online as well as other examples found online.
### I chose Python because I feel like it's a really important language that I need more practice with and would like to work with more.
### These problems were completed on a Windows machine with PyCharm as my IDE.

## Prerequisites (Links for Windows):
- Python3: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
- Node >= 14: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- AWS CDK: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html
- AWS CLI: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html & https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html
- Chocolatey (not required but definitely helps): https://chocolatey.org/install

## Setup
Configure AWS credentials and install CDK globally. Bootstrap CDK for your AWS account.

```shell
cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNTNUMBER/REGION
```

Install the Python dependencies via:

To manually create a virtualenv:

```
$ py -m venv .venv
```

Activate virtualenv on Windows:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Install required dependencies:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

## Deployment
Follow the above steps and run `cdk deploy`.

## Teardown
Follow the above steps and run `cdk destroy`.
